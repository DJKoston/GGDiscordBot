# GG-Bot
Private Discord Bot for the GG Stream Team.  

Feel free to fork this repo if you wish to use the code.

All code is presented as is and I will not be providing any support.

## How to setup config:
Be sure to make a copy of the appsettings.Example.json file in the DiscordBot.Bot directory. Alternatively you can remove the ".Example" portion of the appsettings.json file name.

Add your Discord and Twitch Dev Tokens in here along with your connection string for the SQL database.

Just know you WILL need to Git Bash in order to generate the SQL database and tables in order for the bot to work.
